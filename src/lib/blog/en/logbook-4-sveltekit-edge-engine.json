      "content": "Building [antoine.patraldo.com](https://antoine.patraldo.com) wasn't just about aesthetics. The hurdle was creating a platform to manage stories and heavy animations while using minimal resources. My solution? **SvelteKit 5 + Cloudflare Workers**."

      "title": "The Technical Recipe",
      "content": "1. **DIY Auth:** Following Lucia Auth's principles, I built my own system. I use the **Web Crypto API** for hashing (PBKDF2) because standard Node libraries won't run on Cloudflare Workers. Sessions live in a **D1** table with automatic rotation.\n\n2. **Video without a GUI:** To process Antoine's animations, I use **FFMPEG** from the command line. I automate scaling and conversion to web-friendly formats before uploading. No bloated editors; just Bash scripts.\n\n3. **Svelte 5 (Runes):** Using `$state` and `$derived` allowed me to manage Antoine's gallery with a level of fluidity I couldn't achieve in previous versions."

      "content": "You don't need expensive infrastructure or the latest hardware. With a Chromebook, some Bash, and Svelte 5, you can build an engine capable of powering years of accumulated art."
